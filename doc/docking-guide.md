## Introduction

Molecular docking and virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) are computational techniques used to predict the binding modes and affinities of small molecules to protein targets. AI has revolutionized these approaches by improving accuracy, speed, and scalability. This guide focuses on integrating AI tools into traditional docking and vHTS workflows.

## Preparing Target Structures

### Target Selection and Preparation

| Step | Description | AI-Enhanced Tools |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Structure Selection | Identify high-quality protein structures | [AlphaFold DB](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/), [TargetNet](https://github.com/TargetNetPrediction) |
| Structure Preparation | Clean and prepare structures for docking | [PrepWizard-AI](https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source), [ADFR-Suite](https://ccsb.scripps.edu/adfr/) |
| Binding Site Prediction | Predict potential binding sites | [P2Rank](https://github.com/rdk/p2rank), [DeepSite](https://github.com/BalbesVladislav/DeepSite) |

### Key AI Advantages
- Improved binding site prediction accuracy using deep learning
- Better handling of protein flexibility and water molecules
- Enhanced structure refinement and preparation

### Code Example: AI-Based Binding Site Prediction

```python
# Example code for binding site prediction using DeepSite
from deepsite import DeepSitePredictor
import os
from pymol import cmd

# Load protein structure
protein_path = "protein_structure.pdb"
cmd.load(protein_path, "protein")

# Initialize predictor
predictor = DeepSitePredictor()

# Predict binding sites
binding_sites = predictor.predict(protein_path)

# Output results
for i, site in enumerate(binding_sites):
    center = site.center
    print(f"Binding Site {i+1}: Score {site.score}, Center: {center}")
    
    # Create a selection around the binding site center
    cmd.select(f"site_{i+1}", f"protein within 8 of [x={center[0]}, y={center[1]}, z={center[2]}]")
    cmd.show("surface", f"site_{i+1}")
    cmd.color(f"cyan", f"site_{i+1}")

# Save session
cmd.save("binding_sites.pse")
```

## Ligand Library Preparation

### Building and Curating Libraries

| Step | Description | AI-Enhanced Tools |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Library Generation | Generate diverse compound libraries | [REINVENT](https://github.com/MolecularAI/Reinvent), [DeepChem](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem) |
| Property Prediction | Predict ADMET properties | [ADMETlab 2.0](https://admetmesh.scbdd.com/), [SwissADME](http://www.swissadme.ch/) |
| Ligand Preparation | Generate 3D conformers and tautomers | [RDKit](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit), [TautEnum-AI](https://github.com/PatWalters/TautEnum) |

### Key AI Advantages
- Generative models for targeted compound design

### Code Example: AI-Generated Focused Library

```python
# Example code for generating compounds with REINVENT
from reinvent.model import Model
from reinvent.scoring.scoring import ScoringFunction
from reinvent.chemistry import Conversions
import torch

# Load pre-trained model
model = Model.load_from_file("reinvent_model.ckpt")
scoring_function = ScoringFunction()  # Custom scoring function
conversions = Conversions()

# Define target properties (e.g., similarity to a known active compound)
target_smiles = "CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O"  # Aspirin

# Run the generative model with guidance
generated_smiles = []
for _ in range(1000):  # Generate 1000 compounds
    sampled = model.sample(1)
    smile = sampled[0]
    score = scoring_function.score(smile)
    
    # Only keep high-scoring compounds
    if score > 0.7:
        generated_smiles.append(smile)

# Convert to 3D structures for docking
for i, smile in enumerate(generated_smiles):
    mol = conversions.smile_to_mol(smile)
    
    # Generate 3D coordinates
    # ... (code to generate 3D conformers) ...
    
    # Save to file
    with open(f"compound_{i}.sdf", "w") as f:
        # ... (code to write SDF) ...
```

mols = list(Chem.SDMolSupplier(compound_library))

# Perform docking with AI scoring
results = []
for idx, mol in enumerate(mols):
    if mol is not None:
        # Generate docking poses
        poses = model.generate_poses(mol, n_poses=10)
        
        # Score poses with the deep learning model
        scores = model.score_poses(poses)
        
        # Get best pose and score
        best_idx = np.argmax(scores)
        best_pose = poses[best_idx]
        best_score = scores[best_idx]
        
        results.append({
            'mol_idx': idx,
            'smiles': Chem.MolToSmiles(mol),
            'score': best_score,
            'pose': best_pose
        })

# Sort compounds by score
results.sort(key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)

# Output top results
with open("deepdock_results.csv", "w") as f:
    f.write("Rank,Compound_ID,SMILES,Score\n")
    for i, result in enumerate(results[:100]):  # Top 100 compounds
        f.write(f"{i+1},{result['mol_idx']},{result['smiles']},{result['score']}\n")
        
        # Save top pose
        with Chem.SDWriter(f"pose_{i+1}.sdf") as writer:
            writer.write(result['pose'])
```
